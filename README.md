# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning
In this repository, you can find DeepRL-based solutions to some problmes.
You can see the solved problems in the below list:
- Mountain Car: Using deep Q learning with a simple feed forward
- Sliding Racket: Using deep convolutional Q learning with a simple CNN. A pretty simple environment is also provided
